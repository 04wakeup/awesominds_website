      <p class="p-left">Greetings, We Are Adam, Walker and James and together we are team Awesominds. Awesominds is a web-based learning app that allows Camosun Instructors to add their content and make it available to their students in the form of games. The Awesominds Project has been worked on by two previous capstone groups. For this phase of the project we will be looking at improving some of the instructor menus such as adding start dates and end dates to chapters, also game changes like adding a stop feature for the game.   </p>
